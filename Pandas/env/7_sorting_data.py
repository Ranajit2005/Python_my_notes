'''
sorting data in pandas can be done using the sort_values() method.
You can sort by one or more columns, and you can specify the order (ascending or descending) for each column.
You can also sort by index using the sort_index() method.
The formate is df.sort_values(by='column_name', ascending=True/False, inplace=True)
You can also sort by multiple columns by passing a list to the 'by' parameter.
You can also sort by index using the sort_index() method.
The formate is df.sort_index(ascending=True/False, inplace=True)
If any NaN values are present in the column being sorted, they will be placed at the end of the sorted DataFrame by default.

'''
When you pass two columns to df.sort_values(), pandas will sort the DataFrame based on both columns in order of priority â€” the first column is the primary key, and the second column is the secondary key.

How it works:
1) It first sorts the DataFrame by col1.
2) If there are ties (duplicate values) in col1, it then sorts those tied rows using col2.
